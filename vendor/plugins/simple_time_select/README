SIMPLE TIME SELECT PLUGIN

Ever wanted a time select component with only one select field? This simple plugin 
gives you that component and allows you to set minute intervals. If you set your
minute interval to 15, you get options such as:
"6:00 PM", "6:15 PM", "6:30 PM", etc.

If no minute interval is specified, the control defaults to a 15 minute interval. 
As you can see from the sample values above, this control also implements an AM/PM time
format.

Also note that this component is great if you ONLY want the time from a user. As is, the code
prevents the hidden date fields associated with the time_select helper from being created. This means
that a couple lines of code on the controller side are necessary to make this work. See USAGE for details.

USAGE:

To create the time select:

  <%= time_select "event", "time", { :default => Time.now.change(:hour => 21), :simple_time_select => true, :minute_interval => 20, :time_separator => "" } %>

Don't forget to include the time_separator option.  Otherwise you will get an extra colon outside of the select field.

When the time is submitted, you will have the value in params on the controller side as shown below:
  
  params[:event][:"time(i)"]

Simply add these lines of code to your handler to play nicely with ActiveRecord:

  params[:event][:time] = Time.parse(params[:event][:"time(i)"])
  params[:event].delete(:"time(i)")

Now the time will be correct, but the date will be the current date.  Here are a couple options for changing the date:

1) Change the date in your controller (replace anything in < > with your own variables):
  
  params[:event][:time] = params[:event][:time].change(:year => <year_var>, :day => <day_var>, :month => <month_var>)
  *I do not use this method, you may need to cast params[:event][:time] to a Time object before applying "change" to it.

2) Change the date in an ActiveRecord callback in your model.  This is my preferred method:

  def before_validation
    # Assuming date is your Date variable
    self.time = self.time.change(:year => date.year, :day => date.day, :month => date.month)
  end
