    events: "Gives access to all events sorted, by default, by start_time.

      The @for@ attribute can be any of the following:

      * \"today\"
      * \"tomorrow\"
      * \"yesterday\"
      * a date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2009-03-14)
      * a relative number of days, weeks, months, or years from the current day (e.g., \"next 2 weeks\", \"previous 7 days\")

      The @inclusive@ attribute applies to the relative @for@ values. If set to
      true (the default) then the current day is included; otherwise the current
      day is excluded.

      Events can be sorted, with the @by@ attribute, by name, location, date,
      start_time and end_time; the order of sorting is determined by the @order@
      attribute (default is to sort events in ascending order by start time).

      *Usage*:
      
      <pre><code><r:events [for=\"date\" [inclusive=\"true|false\"]] [by=\"attribute\"] [order=\"asc|desc\"] [limit=\"count\"] [offset=\"count\"] /></code</pre>"
    events-each: "Loops through events."
    events-each-event: "Creates the context for a single event."
    event-name: "Renders the name for the current event."
    event-date: "Renders the date for the current event.
    
      An optional date format string, as used for @Date#strftime@, may be
      specified with the @format@ attribute (the default is @%Y-%m-%d@).

      *Usage*:
      
      <pre><code><r:event:date [format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"] /></code></pre>"
    event-time: "Renders the time for the current event.

      An optional time format string, as used for @Date#strftime@, may be
      specified with the @format@ attribute (the default is @%H:%M@).

      For events with both start and end time values, the @connector@ attribute
      sets the text that separates the start and end time strings (the default
      is a single hyphen).

      *Usage*:
      
      <pre><code><r:event:time [format=\"%H:%M\"] [connector=\"-\"] /></code</pre>"
