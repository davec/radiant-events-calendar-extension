* temporary hack to allow for textile toolbar [Jim Gay]

* Fix for IE [David Cato]

* Make the public-facing calendar work with jQuery [David Cato]

== v0.9.1

* Force setting of page filter when creating event [David Cato]

  Need to have a known page filter defined for events so that the
  rendering is consistent, regardless of the page filter setting in the
  containing project.

* DRY up calendar display with lowpro behaviors [David Cato]

* Add <r:event:time:start> and <r:event:time:end> tags [David Cato]

  the dependency on shared_layouts. Changes to the events page can now be
  made easily without requiring a re-deploy.

  Added additional tags (<r:event:if_time>, <r:event:if_location>,
  <r:event:if_description>, <r:event:if_category>, and their unless
  counterparts) and changed <r:event:description> to return the
  HTML-formatted description instead of the raw description.

== v0.8

* Version bump

== v0.5

* Add event copy functionality [David Cato]
    
  Create a new event based on an existing event. This is a quick-and-dirty
  way of providing multi-day events; specify the details for the first day
  and make copies for subsequent days, changing the date for each copy.

* Clean up tests  [David Cato]

* Fix calendar navigation when JavaScript is disabled  [David Cato]

* Fix remove error. Closes #2  [David Cato]

* Add relative time periods for event date spec  [David Cato]

  The `for' attribute now accepts relative time periods of the format
  /(next|previous) \d+ (day|month|week|year)s?/
    
  So the following can now be specified:
    
  <r:events for="next 2 weeks" /> or <r:events for="previous 1 month" />
    
  By default, today is included, but if the `inclusive' attribute is passed
  the (string literal) value of anything other than "true" then today is
  not included in the result.

* Set start_time to match date [David Cato]

  Two events used Date.today.year for the date but hard-coded year 2009
  for the start_time.

* Clean up JS code [David Cato]

  Declare vars and don't initialize the last filter name to the default
  filter since doing so prevents the filter help from being displayed
  until the selected filter is changed.

* Add auto-complete to category input field [David Cato]

* Add syntax change warning and contributors list [David Cato]

== v0.4

* Add default scope [David Cato]

  Set default order by start_time

* Updated README; added category attribute for <r:events> [Jeremy Stephens]

* Changed syntax for dates in <r:events> [Jeremy Stephens]

  - The year/month/day attributes in <r:events> are gone, use `for` (see
    documentation for <r:events>)
  - Added special days: today, tomorrow, yesterday

* Changed the behavior of the <r:events> tag for consistency [Jeremy Stephens]

  - <r:events> now gets all events by default; this is consistent with
    other radius tags (such as <r:children:each>)
  - added several options for <r:events>, including: by, order, limit, and
    offset

* Added category to events [Jeremy Stephens]

* Fix typo [David Cato]

* Highlight today, even if it's a weekend day [David Cato]

* Add docs and attribution [David Cato]

* Improve tooltip size calculations [David Cato]

  This change also constrains the tooltip to fit within the viewport

* Set the default filter on new records [David Cato]

== v0.3

* Update README with config info [David Cato]

* Add filters for the description [David Cato]

* Remove project-specific snippets [David Cato]

* Fix RE to ignore non-terminal periods [David Cato]

== v0.2

* Restrict allowed tags in event tooltip description [David Cato]

* Use a shortened description in the calendar tooltip [David Cato]

* Move event data generation into a partial [David Cato]

* Adjust tooltip sizing [David Cato]

* Various fixes to the tooltip loading for IE [David Cato]

  For HTML responses, the makeToolTip func is not run until after the DOM
  is loaded. Running it before the DOM has finished loading caused page
  rendering difficulties in IE6 and IE7.
    
  Also tweaked the positioning of the calendar month label.

* More workarounds for RedCloth quirks [David Cato]

* Get mouseovers working in IE [David Cato]

  The onmouseover/onmouseout event handlers cannot be added to an
  element with Element.writeAttribute() in IE.

* More newlines to work around RedCloth quirks [David Cato]

* Add note about Radiant versions [David Cato]

* Fix REs in specs [David Cato]

  The specs were never updated after implementing the RedCloth bug hack
  which caused the tests for calendar contents to fail because of the
  added newlines.

* Fix CSS for tooltip footer [David Cato]

* Remove bottom border from calendar day names [David Cato]

* Allow tooltips to break out of jail [David Cato]

  If a calendar is placed in a div that has overflow:hidden, the tooltips
  would be clipped. By creating a separate div at the end of the document
  body to hold the current tooltip, the overflow property of the calendar
  container does not affect the display of the tooltip.
    
  Tooltip position calculation was also adjusted so that the tooltip will
  display within the current viewport (and switch sides if it extends off
  the left side of the viewport) as long as the tooltip size does not
  exceed the size of the viewport.

* Work around for a RedCloth bug [David Cato]

  If the calendar is included in a snippet or page that uses Textile
  formatting, the single-line string of unbroken text caused RedCloth to
  insert spurious p tags, resulting in invalid HTML. Inserting newlines
  in various parts of the table seems to fix the problem.

* Impose order on the events [David Cato]

  Modify the for_date named_scope to order the events by start_time and
  name.
    
  Additionally, modify Admin::EventsController#load_models to order the
  events by date, start_time, and name and also to exclude past events
  (if someone wants to rewrite history, they'll have to work at it) so
  the index of events has a sensible order.
